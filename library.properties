sentence=Lightweight bit-bang I2C Master library with cross-platform compatibility
paragraph=A minimal I2C master implementation using bit-banging technique, optimized for ATtiny and ATmega microcontrollers with automatic platform detection. Uses direct register manipulation on AVR for maximum efficiency, falls back to digitalWrite/digitalRead on other platforms. Features Wire-like API with beginTransmission/endTransmission/requestFrom functions and three-level architecture for maximum portability.
